HB-EGF/Tar Receptor (HT) Device
This part is a chimeric between extracellular (binding) domain of Homo sapiens heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) receptor and transmembrane/intracellular domain of Escherichia coli Tar chemotaxis receptor.

Usage and Biology
This part can be used to detect diphtheria toxin as it has HB-EGF binding domain. It also can activate chemotaxis pathway in E. coli upon receptor activation as it has Tar transmembrane/intracellular domain.
