# CynRefine

Welcome to the CynRefine project! This tool aims to provide iGEM teams and anyone wishing to browse the open science repository with a bit more ease, following complaints from our own
team as well as others in regards to how hard it can be to find the right part. The current state just includes the .venv and a few lines of code, but the goal is to produce:

- A web scraper to collect parts
- A search bar interface on a separate website
- A new datastructure that can store each part with tags that are more relevant to iGEM searches
